# Kir's travel tips

I've travelled more than 30 countries during the last few years.
I always make a note when someone tells me "Oh, you should totally visit that place in %city%"

This is a list of points of interested sorted by cities.
Having an item included in the list doesn't guarantee it's worth visiting, but you may consider it.
I hope that at some point I'll be able to convert into into a guide of place that I've been to.

PRs are welcome.
